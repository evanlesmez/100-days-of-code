##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

## Plan

I will complete the [Vegan Hacktivist](https://gist.github.com/GRardB/7e2990bbea8c2e50e2b501b712d8c169) to join the team and help promote the philosophy of veganism.

### Day 1: January 01, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Got through section 9 of laravel from scratch laracast to learn laravel framework. 

**Thoughts** Got a little stuck on the section about controllers but it was because the video was outdated. Looked through documentation to find that the syntax was updated since a year ago for routing with controllers.

### Day 2: January 02, Saturday 

**Today's Progress**: Hooked the post controller up to mysql database hosted on localhost within homestead environment. Used artisan to manage migrations and models. 

**Thoughts** A little tricky getting mysql auth credentials sorted but figured out the homestead defaults via one of the links below. Very similar flow to Django development.

### Day 3: January 03, Sunday 

**Today's Progress**: Made it through section 4 of the laracast Laravel from Scratch. Created an MVC for Articles and dynamically rendered content into php blade layouts and views.

**Thoughts** Using webpack with the laravel and mix and node.js was neat. Seems like a feature I was missing when working with flask and bundling non-vanilla js

### Day 4: January 04, Monday 

**Today's Progress**: Created articles RESTful actions and got through a few more lessons. 

**Thoughts** Struggled today. Coding after working 8-9 hours of coding for work is tough.

### Day 5: January 05, Tuesday 

**Today's Progress**: Created a raspberry pi 3 access point

**Thoughts** Pretty neat you can create access point in a 30 minutes to an hour with a raspberry pi

### Day 6, January 06, Wednessday

**Today's Progress**: Made it through the forms section on laravel from scratch

**Thoughts** Neat that laravel has so many functions available for blade templates to consume but it is not a very explicit pattern.

### Day 7, January 07, Thursday 

**Today's Progress**: Controllers refactored. Factories for users and articles. Route naming for avoiding hardcodes. 

**Thoughts** Factories are super usefl. Think laravel is kinda of tricky to track down which classes come form where.
